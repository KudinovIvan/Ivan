About the company: a microenterprise that produces chemical products (detergents for dishes, glasses, cars (+ additional means with wax content), fertilizers based on glycerin, with the possibility of pickup or delivery to a warehouse (delivery to retail outlets is not considered).
Production and delivery of products is carried out in different volumes and containers (from cans of 5 liters to orders of 2-3 tons). Also individually used containers that are convenient for the customer (for example, detergent in a bottle of no more than 1 liter, or in barrels). The company has a stock of the product, but ordering a large volume or in a specific container increases the delivery time.
The purpose of this project is to optimize the work of the sole proprietor, as well as to increase the income and reliability of the system.
The system searches for contests, clients, events where you can sell your product.
